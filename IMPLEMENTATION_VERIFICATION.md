## IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION SUMMARY

### ‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
**Problem**: Students could only see final quiz results, not individual answers for each question.
**Solution**: Added "Lihat Jawaban Saya" buttons to the quiz results page that navigate directly to individual answer details.

### üìÅ FILES MODIFIED
- `/src/app/student/quizzes/[quizId]/QuizSubmissionDetails.tsx` - Added two "Lihat Jawaban Saya" button sections

### üîß IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Added two button sections in the assessment result display:

1. **Primary Section** (lines 397-413):
   - Condition: When `allSubmissions && allSubmissions.length > 0`
   - Navigation: `/student/quizzes/${quizId}/submissions/${allSubmissions[0].id}`
   - Icon: FileText from lucide-react

2. **Fallback Section** (lines 415-431):
   - Condition: When `(!allSubmissions || allSubmissions.length === 0) && lastSubmission`
   - Navigation: `/student/quizzes/${quizId}/submissions/${lastSubmission.id}`
   - Icon: FileText from lucide-react

### üéØ USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENT
**Before**: Students had to navigate History ‚Üí "Lihat Detail Jawaban" to see individual answers
**After**: Students can directly click "Lihat Jawaban Saya" from the main quiz results page

### üîó NAVIGATION FLOW
```
/student/quizzes/[quizId] 
    ‚Üí [Click "Lihat Jawaban Saya"] 
    ‚Üí /student/quizzes/[quizId]/submissions/[submissionId]
```

### üìù IMPLEMENTATION HANDLES BOTH SCENARIOS
1. **When allSubmissions exists**: Uses `allSubmissions[0].id` (most recent submission)
2. **When only lastSubmission exists**: Uses `lastSubmission.id` as fallback

The solution is complete and ready for user testing!
